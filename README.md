# ashleygwilliams/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I am a instructor at the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com), when I currently lead the [NYC Web Development Fellowshop](http://flatironschool.com/workforce1) that we run out of our Brooklyn Campus in DUMBO.

I teach ruby, javascript, the myriad of libraries and frameworks associated with web development work with those languages. I have also given several talks on git, Github, and open source contribution, particulary documentation.

If you're interested in Flatiron School, learning ruby or javascript, contributing to open source software, or just want to pick my brain about teaching programming and programming languges, I would love to talk to you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

Twitter is, by far, the easiest way to get in touch with me, especially if it's something quick. I'm [@ag_dubs](https://twitter.com/ag_dubs) on
Twitter.
